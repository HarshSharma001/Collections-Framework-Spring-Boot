        <p>Hey user, myself Harsh Sharma, the developer of this website. I'm pursuing my BTech from HCE Sonepat, trying to evolve and enhance
            my skills to new heights. I'm still not good at DSA, and used to stuck on problems on daily basis, but I'll keep trying to improvise
            myself and to be better at it. Apart from that, pardon me for this childish user-interface of this website, I really don't intend to be
            a frontend developer. I tried my best in testing my implementations of <strong>Collections Framework</strong>, but there must be some corner cases/unrevealed flaws, so you may feel free to provide feedback to me on that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regards <br>
            Harsh Sharma
